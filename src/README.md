    <h1>Unpacking the Finance Bill 2024: Wins, Losses, and Unclear Changes</h1>
    <p>The National Assembly Finance & Planning Committee's report on the Finance Bill 2024 is out, and it's quite a mixed bag. In this blog post, we'll dive into the key highlights. From the removal of the Motor Vehicle Tax to the introduction of Withholding Tax on Infrastructure Bonds, let's break down what this report means for Kenya's economy.</p>

  <h2>A Closer Look at the Proposed Changes</h2>

  <div>
    <h3>Motor Vehicle Tax and Road Maintenance Levy</h3>
    <p>While the Motor Vehicle Tax has been removed, the <strong>Road Maintenance Levy is set to increase by a whopping 38.9% from KES 18/liter to KES 25/liter</strong>. This change is expected to have a significant impact on fuel prices, with Super petrol moving from KES 189.84/liter to KES 196.84/liter, Diesel from KES 173.10/liter to KES 180.10/liter, and Kerosene from KES 163.05/liter to KES 170.05/liter.</p>

  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Excise Duty Amendments</h3>
    <p>There's good news for manufacturers, internet service providers, and consumers as the proposed repeal of Section 14 of the Excise Duty Act on excise duty offset between inputs & outputs has been rescinded. Additionally, the proposed increase in excise duty on telephone, internet, and mobile money transfers from 15% to 20% has been dropped.</p>

  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Import Taxes and Significant Economic Presence Tax</h3>
    <p>The committee has retained the proposed increase in Import Declaration Fee from 2.5% to 3%. However, the effective tax rate for Significant Economic Presence Tax remains unclear. The committee suggests it could be 10% of deemed income of gross turnover to moderate to 3%, while another part indicates it could be retained at 20% of deemed income of gross turnover.</p>

  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>VAT Exemptions and Data Protection</h3>
    <p>In a win for the financial sector, the proposal to introduce VAT on financial services has been rescinded, and excise duty on money transfers remains at 15%. Moreover, the proposal to exempt KRA from Data Protection Act constraints regarding accessing taxpayers' data has been rescinded.</p>

  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Withholding Taxes and Other Changes</h3>
    <p>Withholding Tax is being introduced on goods supplied to public entities and Infrastructure Bonds, which will raise the government's own funding costs. On the other hand, capital gains tax on the transfer of property to family trusts has been dropped.</p>
